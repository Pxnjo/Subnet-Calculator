# Subnet Calculator

This project allows you to calculate the subnets of a network. The repository contains the source code in a folder and an executable `.exe` file in another folder. 

## How to Use

1. **Run the executable**: 
   - Navigate to the folder containing the `.exe` file.
   - Double-click on `nuova_cartella.exe` (Apologies, but this was one of my first projects, and I never renamed it).
   
2. **Input Host Counts**:
   - You will be prompted to enter the number of hosts you want for each subnet. For example:
     ```
     500
     200
     100
     ```
   - To finish entering hosts, type `0` and press `Enter`. This indicates that you have finished specifying the number of hosts.

3. **Input Network Information**:
   - After specifying the hosts, you will be asked to provide the network's division into 4 parts. For example:
     ```
     10
     0
     0
     0
     ```
   - Enter the network parts one by one, pressing `Enter` after each input.

4. **Get the Result**:
   - Once you have provided all the required information, the script will output the subnet table with the calculated subnets.


### Output:
The script will calculate and display the subnet table based on your input.

## Notes

- This project was one of my early scripts, and some names may not be very intuitive. Apologies for that!
- You can modify the code as needed for your specific requirements.
